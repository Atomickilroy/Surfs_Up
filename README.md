# Surfs_Up

## Overview of Project
#### - *This project follows two friends on a joint business venture in Hawaii on the island of Oahu. Their goal is to run and operate a surf and icecream shop. Inorder for this to become a reality they need to have additional investors. By presenting visualtizations and dateframes of the weather data, to the investors. The vision of this oppurtunity can be more easliy conveyed while being backed by the data.* 

## Purpose

-  *The purpose of this project was to spend time with new and old tools:*
    - Such as: SQLite, Flask, SQLAlchemy, VSCode, Python, Pandas, Jupyter Notebook
    - Create a local database 
    - Connect to the data base to run querys
    - Use Flask to but a rudamentery web page to build routes to the display aspects of our analysis.

## Results

## Summary:
---
### ***Location selected based on temperature with travel routes.*** 

#Looking at this plot, we can infer that a vast majority of the observations were over 67 degrees



There is a high-level summary of the results and there are two additional queries to perform to gather more weather data for June and December. (5 pt)

### ***Inital map of the world with all areas where the temp was between 65 (F) and 85(F)***
